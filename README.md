# basic_algorithms_python

Experiments with basic algorithms in python. Reference problems are as follows:

1. Computing square root of an integer
2. Searching for a terget in a rotated array
3. form two numbers from elements in a given array, so that their sum is maximum possible
4. sort 0-1-2 array
5. implement autocomplete using Trie
6. find max and min in an unsorted array
7. HTTP router implementation using a Trie
